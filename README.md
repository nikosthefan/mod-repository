# mod-repository
This is my mod-repository. Here you can find all my mods for stonehearth, but only the latest version, scince the mods rely on the name (, which means I can't just trow in version numbers and expect it to work).
If you really want an older version of one of my mods, PM me on the discourse, or ask me for it in the corresponing thread.

Download-instructions for those who are new to Github:
To download all my mods (if you really wanted to, that is), you press the download button on top of this repository.
You'll more likely want to download just one of the mods present here, in which case you click on the link of the file, which brings you to a new page, and there you'll find a new download button specifically for that mod.
